#  Branching Strategy

### Some github branches;

1. Master
    Master branch is the most stable branch of all and will be used for production deployment.

2. Develop
    Develop branch is created from master branch and will contain the latest features and bugfixes.

3. Feature/bugfix
    Multiple Feature branches and bugfix branches can be created from develop branch for feature development.

4. Release
    Release branch is created from develop branch with all the features which are planned for next release.

5. Hotfix
    Hotfix branch will be created from the master branch, this branch comes in when there's some very important fix to be done as soon as possible and sent back for production.

### Let us understand how we shall be usin these all branches and what will be the impact of each branch.

At this point let us assume we already had a Master and Develop branch.
1. To start working on a new feature, we will create a new feature branch feature/f1 out of Develop.
2. Also a small feature started in parallel, we call that branch feature/f2.

3. feature/f2 task is completed and it will be merged to develop and at the same time it has to be merged to feature/f1.

4. It’s decided to put feature/f2 in the next release which is planned in the next few weeks.

5. At this point we will create a release branch from develop with a version tag. We call this branch release/v0.1.0. And this release branch will be sent for testing.

6. During testing we got some issues again and created some other bugfix1 and bugfix2 branches out of release. Once bugfix1 and bugfix2 are merged to release, make sure to merge back to develop and feature/f1.

7. Once we are sure with the testing, this branch is now much more stable and we are ready to merge it to the master branch. And again send the Master branch for testing.

8. During testing we again faced an issue, and this time we have to create a hotfix branch out of master, we call this branch hotfix/hf1.

9. Once the hotfix branch is merged to master, it will be merged back to develop and feature/f1 branch.

10. Cheer’s, we have the most stable branch “The Master Branch”, and we are ready to deploy this to production.

One of the most important things to be noted is that TESTING plays a major role in getting the most stable branches, so make sure to get it tested enough before you say Master as the most STABLE branch.
